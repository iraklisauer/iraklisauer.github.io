        </div>
                
        <div>
            <font size="3"> In this paper, we examine the effects on immigrant skill selection of a visa liberalization policy that 
                was originally tailored towards short-term stays. From 2009 on, as part of the EU visa liberalization legislature, 
                Germany has introduced a bilateral visa-free movement with a number of non-EU countries from Eastern Europe. Although 
                there has been a substantial rise in arrival numbers to Germany after the reform, we know little about the indirect 
                effects of such policies in terms of skills selection in the source country's labor market. In our empirical analysis, 
                we treat visa liberalization as a quasi-experiment and visa-free movement as a means to reduce migration costs. Our 
                study is among the first to exploit within-origin-country variation in migration costs. The results suggest that the
                policy has a positive effect on skills selection. However, the immigrants without university degrees benefit the most
                in entry wages. This sparks a discussion on the existence of possible bias when examining the skills selection based 
                on education.   </font>

         </div> 
                 
         <div>   
                 <font size="3">  In this paper, I examine the heterogeneities in the motherhood penalty (MHP) in Germany based 
                 on the mothers' cultural origins. I compare immigrant mothers' labor market outcomes and reaction to a childcare 
                 allowance policy to those of native mothers. The main findings suggest that the outcomes between the groups diverge 
                 after the first year after childbirth. Foreigners return time on average later than the natives to the labor market.
                    In the long run, natives have the smallest motherhood penalty. The results from the analysis of the effects of the 
                    introduction of a childcare allowance policy on the return time to employment suggest that foreigners from predominantly
                    Muslim countries that are in the lowest parts of earnings distribution react negatively to child allowance policy 
                    dependent on their pre-childbirth earnings compared to the natives.   </font>

                <font size="3">We investigate the wage assimilation of East Germans who migrated to West Germany after reunification 
                (1990-1999). We compare their wage assimilation to that of ethnic German immigrants from Eastern Bloc countries and 
                international immigrants to West Germany who arrived at the same time. The analysis uses administrative as well as 
                survey data. The results suggest that East Germans faced significant initial earnings disadvantages in West Germany, 
                even conditional on age and education. However, these disadvantages were smaller than those of international immigrants, 
                supporting the beneficial role of cultural similarity. The earnings gap relative to West German natives narrowed over time 
                for all immigrants. These findings are robust to controlling for potentially endogenous return migration and labor force 
                participation. Controls for fixed effects reveal that positive assimilation for East German and international immigrants 
                was concentrated among highly educated immigrants.</font>
